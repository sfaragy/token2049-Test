# Repo to accomplish the Case study for Backend Developer in Token2049.

## My Work Plan:
1. Prepare an Isolated Dockerize Environment.
2. Prepare Database Migrations, Model, Controller and expose expected checkout API endpoint.
3. Prepare Webhook Receiver endpoint with mock payload and validation.
4. If I have time I will try to prepare PHPUnit test coverage with Red-Green-Refactor in mind.
5. Documentation on how to run the project including future improvement possibilities.
6. Finally make the workflow to deploy in DigitalOcean.
